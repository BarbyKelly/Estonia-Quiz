## Design

### Images

* FAVICON

Developer used an image of a cornflower (Estonian national flower), from her own collection, to create Favicon.

The original image: 

![cornflower](cornflower.jpg)


This website helped to convert the image into Favicon:
https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

Screenshot of favicon on the website:

![cornflower favicon image](faviconreadme.png)


### Color
* As Estonian national flower is Cornflower, I chose Background color 'cornflower blue', found from this website: 
https://htmlcolorcodes.com/colors/cornflower-blue/

![CORNFLOWER BLUE COLOR](docs/readmeimg/cornflowerblue.png)

* Color palette from this website:
https://mycolor.space/?hex=%236495ED&sub=1

...Natural Palette or Neighbor Palette, which suits better. Add screenshot then of the palette used...

## Bug fixing

* Favicon

At first favicon icon did not appear on the website. Developer had used the four line code from favicon.io
https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

![screenshot of favicon codes](faviconcodes.png)

After comparing Favicon codes to the codes from Love Running, developer noticed that path needed to be adjusted. After adjusting the path, favicon appeared on the website.
